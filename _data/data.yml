      company: Computational Cognitive Science Lab, University of Melbourne
      details: |
        Advisor: Dr. Amy Perfors

          - Developed a computational framework to identify the presence of latent causal variables in psychological
            representations
          - Developed a new algorithm for the automated identification of Generic Noun Phrases (a linguistic form which plays
            a key role in the development of essentialist beliefs in children)

    - role: Summer Research Intern
      time: May, 2018 - July, 2018
      company: Institute for Natural Language Processing, University of Stuttgart
      details: |
        Advisor: Dr. Nils Reiter 
          - Developed a research tool which automatically detects intertextual references and allusions made in literary texts
            by evaluating syntactic and semantic similarity
          -The tool has been used by literary researchers at the University of Stuttgart to study intertextual references made
            by the German Philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche.
          - A proof-of-concept and description of our methodology can be found here: http://github.com/samarth1397/DetectingAllusion.
